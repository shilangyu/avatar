## history

Long ago when I was first learning to code, I was into watching [The Coding train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw), writing [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) code, and learning about AI/ML. At some point I created a simple genetic algorithm library, an early version of [genetic.ts](https://github.com/shilangyu/genetic.ts). I then used it to create a small web app which would show many generated shapes with varying parameters. The user (me) would then select those which they liked and start a new generation which would create a new population of shapes with evolved parameters according personal preference. After a few generations all shapes would end up very similar to each other, the population has converged. The winning shape became my avatar.

## today

All that I had left from this project was a [single png file](./original.png), everything else got lost. This repository tries to faithfully restore the original avatar in a vector format.
